# face-recognition-

The project does three things 
    
      1. detect face from the image added
      2. learns the facial features necessary to detect a person
      3. uses trained model to detect the face added 
      
the dataset is not uploaded in the repository as the dataset created was images of my friends and family members.

here i have used transfer learning to reduce the computational power 

pretrained model used is VGGFace as it is one of the best pre trained models available on the internet

## dependencies 

      1. numpy 
      2. PIL
      3. keras_vggface
      4. cv2
      4. matplotlib
      5. mycnn for face detection
